# Recipe Sharing Platform
Recipe Sharing Platform is a recipes & social media platform for home chefs and & food-lovers alike. Here, users can find recipes, along with upcoming cooking events both in their local cities and online, and find out about cookbooks suggested by other members of the community. Users are invited to interact with each other by sharing recipes, cookbooks and cooking experiences.
