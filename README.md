# Recipe Sharing Platform
Recipe Sharing Platform is a recipes & social media platform for home chefs and & food-lovers alike. Here, users can find recipes, along with upcoming cooking events both in their local cities and online, and find out about cookbooks suggested by other members of the community. Users are invited to interact with each other by sharing recipes, cookbooks and cooking experiences.

## UX

### Site Purpose:
To bring interactivity to the culinary community by sharing the recipes, cooking events, cookbooks, and feedback from other cooking enthusiasts.

### Site Goal:
Recipe Sharing Platform is intended to create an online recipe archive built upon the home recipes shared by the community, as well as bring people together by suggesting cooking experiences and cookbooks with each other.

### Audience:
Everyone with an interest in cooking, and the desire to reach out & connect with like-minded individuals.

### Communication:
The layout is intended to represent a basic social platform, whilst at the same time having a playful, interactive feel to it. With the navigation panel being present at all times, the users can quickly navigate through the site to arrive at their intended destination.

### Current User Goals:
To keep users coming back again and again to see what is new in terms of recipes, events, and books, as well as to follow up with other users that they follow.

### New User Goals:
To engage the user in a meaningful way, and encourage them to explore everything that the site has to offer.

### Future Goals:
- To provide different types of user accounts, so that access is restricted for who may publish specific types of content.
- Provide the ability for users to send private messages to either another user, or a group of users.
- To expand the events section and provide a google maps location for each event, so that users may understand in more detail where an event is to be hosted.
